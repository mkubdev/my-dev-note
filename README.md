## Life Tracking 🔎

### 2019 - 2020 :
  * 🔥 Learned Vanilla JS : 
      - I built a **Vanilla JS API** on topoff an OpenSource project made by [**Mozilla Fundation**](https://foundation.mozilla.org/fr/) : Thanks to this API, read a document and add annotations then perform super precise measurements on PDFs files directly in your browser (Area, perimeter, polyline, length ...). This project is not opensource.
  * Started learning **Angular 7** :
      - I started to study the Angular framework in version 7.
  * 🔥🔥 First software developer job :
      - I joined the [**TFTLabs**](https://www.tftlabs.fr) team as a **software developer**. I am a web applications architect for this company.
  * **Angular 7-8-9 + rxJS** :
      - I continued to study the Angular framework. And i started to learn RxJS library.
  * Started learning **MongoDB + Mongoose** :
      - I had to choose a database solution in the architecture of one of our applications. I chose MongoDB and its Mongoose plugin.
  * Started learning **NestJS** : 
      - NestJS is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js web applications. It uses modern JavaScript, is built with TypeScript and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Progamming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming)
  * 🎁🏆 First year of professional experience.


### 2020 - 2021 :
  * Continue learning **Angular 9-10-11-12** :
      - I continued to study the Angular framework.
  * Started learning **TypeScript 4** :
      - Digging around some new feature from typescript :
          - Variadic Tuple Typescript
          - Labeled Tuple Elements
          - Class Property Inference from Constructors
          - `unknow` on `catch` Clauses
          - Custom JSX Factories (need by React, but i don't use react so much atm...)
          - and more...
  * Started learning **Docker** :
      - I develop all my projects with Docker. I know how to dockerize apps and api.
  * Started learning **Kubernetes** :
      - I spend many hours to understand and apply some devOps standard to upgrade my devOps skills. I know how to set up a little kubernetes server.
  * 🔥 First marketed application (Fullstack) : 
      - I built my first **marketed application** (private client) with **Angular 10 + NestJS** ❤💙 : 
        - This application is intented for a **multi-national group**. From a concept imagined by our partner, we have developed a web application intended for companies wishing to communicate and promote the skills and know-how of their employees.
        This application also makes it possible to **inform** these employees about **developments** or **opportunities** within the company.
        With "administrator" mode, the customer takes control of the application to update the content.
  * 🎁🏆 2+ year of professional experience !!
